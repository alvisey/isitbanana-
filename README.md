## Basic Details
### Team Name: [uselessness]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Alvis CR] - [Jyothi Engineering]
- Member 2: [Aleena Seby] - [Jyothi Engineering]

### Project Description
[An advanced, state-of-the-art, AI-powered, deep-learning, neural-network-based, banana detection system.
Upload any image, and our proprietary algorithm* will determine ‚Äî with groundbreaking accuracy ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs a banana.]

### The Problem 
[In today‚Äôs rapidly advancing digital society, one question continues to plague humanity: ‚ÄúIs this a banana?‚Äù
Misidentification of bananas has led to snack-time disappointment, smoothie disasters, and severe potassium mismanagement. No reliable, open-source, browser-based banana recognition tool currently exists.]

### The Solution
[We built IsItBanana ‚Äî a privacy-first, lightning-fast, zero-dependency ‚ÄúAI‚Äù that uses extremely advanced random number generation to instantly tell users if an image is a banana.
It‚Äôs accessible worldwide via the web, requires no installation, and provides confidence levels that make it look legit ‚Äî even though it‚Äôs hilariously useless.]
